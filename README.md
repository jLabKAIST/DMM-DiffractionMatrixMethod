# DiffractionMatrixMethod_DMM
Design code of Diffraction Matrix Method for calculation of periodically corrugated OLEDs

# Notice
In DMM, RETICOLO, which is a rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA) open-source code, is included.


# How to run this code
Run DMM_main.m for 1D corrugated OLED / DMM_2D_main.m for 2D corrugated OLED
