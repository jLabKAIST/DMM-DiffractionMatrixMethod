# DMM:DiffractionMatrixMethod
Authors : Chanhyung Park, Jeongmin Shin, Min Seok Jang
Design code of Diffraction Matrix Method for calculation of periodically corrugated OLEDs

# Notice
In DMM, RETICOLO, which is a rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA) open-source code developed by J. P. Hugonin and P. Lalanne, is included.
Please download RETICOLO V8 or higher version.

# How to run this code
Run DMM_main.m for 1D corrugated OLED / DMM_2D_main.m for 2D corrugated OLED
